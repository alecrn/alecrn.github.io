<h1>Tao Te Ching</h1>
<div class="controls"><a href="#random">Random chapter (or press Ctrl+R)</a></p>

<div class="chapter" id="1">
<h2><a href="#1">1</a></h2>
<p>
The tao that can be told <br>
is not the eternal Tao. <br>
The name that can be named <br>
is not the eternal Name. <br>
</p><p>
The unnamable is the eternally real. <br>
Naming is the origin <br>
of all particular things. <br>
</p><p>
Free from desire, you realize the mystery. <br>
Caught in desire, you see only the manifestations. <br>
</p><p>
Yet mystery and manifestations <br>
arise from the same source. <br>
This source is called darkness. <br>
</p><p>
Darkness within darkness. <br>
The gateway to all understanding. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="2">
<h2><a href="#2">2</a></h2>
<p>
When people see some things as beautiful, <br>
other things become ugly. <br>
When people see some things as good, <br>
other things become bad. <br>
</p><p>
Being and non-being create each other. <br>
Difficult and easy support each other. <br>
Long and short define each other. <br>
High and low depend on each other. <br>
Before and after follow each other. <br>
</p><p>
Therefore the Master <br>
acts without doing anything <br>
and teaches without saying anything. <br>
Things arise and she lets them come; <br>
things disappear and she lets them go. <br>
She has but doesn’t possess, <br>
acts but doesn’t expect. <br>
When her work is done, she forgets it. <br>
That is why it lasts forever. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="3">
<h2><a href="#3">3</a></h2>
<p>
If you overesteem great men, <br>
people become powerless. <br>
If you overvalue possessions, <br>
people begin to steal. <br>
</p><p>
The Master leads <br>
by emptying people’s minds <br>
and filling their cores, <br>
by weakening their ambition <br>
and toughening their resolve. <br>
He helps people lose everything <br>
they know, everything they desire, <br>
and creates confusion <br>
in those who think that they know. <br>
</p><p>
Practice not-doing, <br>
and everything will fall into place. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="4">
<h2><a href="#4">4</a></h2>
<p>
The Tao is like a well: <br>
used but never used up. <br>
It is like the eternal void: <br>
filled with infinite possibilities. <br>
</p><p>
It is hidden but always present. <br>
I don’t know who gave birth to it. <br>
It is older than God. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="5">
<h2><a href="#5">5</a></h2>
<p>
The Tao doesn’t take sides; <br>
it gives birth to both good and evil. <br>
The Master doesn’t take sides; <br>
she welcomes both saints and sinners. <br>
</p><p>
The Tao is like a bellows: <br>
it is empty yet infinitely capable. <br>
The more you use it, the more it produces; <br>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand. <br>
</p><p>
Hold on to the center. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="6">
<h2><a href="#6">6</a></h2>
<p>
The Tao is called the Great Mother: <br>
empty yet inexhaustible, <br>
it gives birth to infinite worlds. <br>
</p><p>
It is always present within you. <br>
You can use it any way you want. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="7">
<h2><a href="#7">7</a></h2>
<p>
The Tao is infinite, eternal. <br>
Why is it eternal? <br>
It was never born; <br>
thus it can never die. <br>
Why is it infinite? <br>
It has no desires for itself; <br>
thus it is present for all beings. <br>
</p><p>
The Master stays behind; <br>
that is why she is ahead. <br>
She is detached from all things; <br>
that is why she is one with them. <br>
Because she has let go of herself, <br>
she is perfectly fulfilled. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="8">
<h2><a href="#8">8</a></h2>
<p>
The supreme good is like water, <br>
which nourishes all things without trying to. <br>
It is content with the low places that people disdain. <br>
Thus it is like the Tao. <br>
</p><p>
In dwelling, live close to the ground. <br>
In thinking, keep to the simple. <br>
In conflict, be fair and generous. <br>
In governing, don’t try to control. <br>
In work, do what you enjoy. <br>
In family life, be completely present. <br>
</p><p>
When you are content to be simply yourself <br>
and don’t compare or compete, <br>
everybody will respect you. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="9">
<h2><a href="#9">9</a></h2>
<p>
Fill your bowl to the brim <br>
and it will spill. <br>
Keep sharpening your knife <br>
and it will blunt. <br>
Chase after money and security <br>
and your heart will never unclench. <br>
Care about people’s approval <br>
and you will be their prisoner. <br>
</p><p>
Do your work, then step back. <br>
The only path to serenity. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="10">
<h2><a href="#10">10</a></h2>
<p>
Can you coax your mind from its wandering <br>
and keep to the original oneness? <br>
Can you let your body become <br>
supple as a newborn child’s? <br>
Can you cleanse your inner vision <br>
until you see nothing but the light? <br>
Can you love people and lead them <br>
without imposing your will? <br>
Can you deal with the most vital matters <br>
by letting events take their course? <br>
Can you step back from you own mind <br>
and thus understand all things? <br>
</p><p>
Giving birth and nourishing, <br>
having without possessing, <br>
acting with no expectations, <br>
leading and not trying to control: <br>
this is the supreme virtue. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="11">
<h2><a href="#11">11</a></h2>
<p>
We join spokes together in a wheel, <br>
but it is the center hole <br>
that makes the wagon move. <br>
</p><p>
We shape clay into a pot, <br>
but it is the emptiness inside <br>
that holds whatever we want. <br>
</p><p>
We hammer wood for a house, <br>
but it is the inner space <br>
that makes it livable. <br>
</p><p>
We work with being, <br>
but non-being is what we use. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="12">
<h2><a href="#12">12</a></h2>
<p>
Colors blind the eye. <br>
Sounds deafen the ear. <br>
Flavors numb the taste. <br>
Thoughts weaken the mind. <br>
Desires wither the heart. <br>
</p><p>
The Master observes the world <br>
but trusts his inner vision. <br>
He allows things to come and go. <br>
His heart is open as the sky. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="13">
<h2><a href="#13">13</a></h2>
<p>
Success is as dangerous as failure. <br>
Hope is as hollow as fear. <br>
</p><p>
What does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure? <br>
Whether you go up the ladder or down it, <br>
you position is shaky. <br>
When you stand with your two feet on the ground, <br>
you will always keep your balance. <br>
</p><p>
What does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear? <br>
Hope and fear are both phantoms <br>
that arise from thinking of the self. <br>
When we don’t see the self as self, <br>
what do we have to fear? <br>
</p><p>
See the world as your self. <br>
Have faith in the way things are. <br>
Love the world as your self; <br>
then you can care for all things. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="14">
<h2><a href="#14">14</a></h2>
<p>
Look, and it can’t be seen. <br>
Listen, and it can’t be heard. <br>
Reach, and it can’t be grasped. <br>
</p><p>
Above, it isn’t bright. <br>
Below, it isn’t dark. <br>
Seamless, unnamable, <br>
it returns to the realm of nothing. <br>
Form that includes all forms, <br>
image without an image, <br>
subtle, beyond all conception. <br>
</p><p>
Approach it and there is no beginning; <br>
follow it and there is no end. <br>
You can’t know it, but you can be it, <br>
at ease in your own life. <br>
Just realize where you come from: <br>
this is the essence of wisdom. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="15">
<h2><a href="#15">15</a></h2>
<p>
The ancient Masters were profound and subtle. <br>
Their wisdom was unfathomable. <br>
There is no way to describe it; <br>
all we can describe is their appearance. <br>
</p><p>
They were careful <br>
as someone crossing an iced-over stream. <br>
Alert as a warrior in enemy territory. <br>
Courteous as a guest. <br>
Fluid as melting ice. <br>
Shapable as a block of wood. <br>
Receptive as a valley. <br>
Clear as a glass of water. <br>
</p><p>
Do you have the patience to wait <br>
till your mud settles and the water is clear? <br>
Can you remain unmoving <br>
till the right action arises by itself? <br>
</p><p>
The Master doesn’t seek fulfillment. <br>
Not seeking, not expecting, <br>
she is present, and can welcome all things. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="16">
<h2><a href="#16">16</a></h2>
<p>
Empty your mind of all thoughts. <br>
Let your heart be at peace. <br>
Watch the turmoil of beings, <br>
but contemplate their return. <br>
</p><p>
Each separate being in the universe <br>
returns to the common source. <br>
Returning to the source is serenity. <br>
</p><p>
If you don’t realize the source, <br>
you stumble in confusion and sorrow. <br>
When you realize where you come from, <br>
you naturally become tolerant, <br>
disinterested, amused, <br>
kindhearted as a grandmother, <br>
dignified as a king. <br>
Immersed in the wonder of the Tao, <br>
you can deal with whatever life brings you, <br>
and when death comes, you are ready. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="17">
<h2><a href="#17">17</a></h2>
<p>
When the Master governs, the people <br>
are hardly aware that he exists. <br>
Next best is a leader who is loved. <br>
Next, one who is feared. <br>
The worst is one who is despised. <br>
</p><p>
If you don’t trust the people, <br>
you make them untrustworthy. <br>
</p><p>
The Master doesn’t talk, he acts. <br>
When his work is done, <br>
the people say, “Amazing: <br>
we did it, all by ourselves!” <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="18">
<h2><a href="#18">18</a></h2>
<p>
When the great Tao is forgotten, <br>
goodness and piety appear. <br>
When the body’s intelligence declines, <br>
cleverness and knowledge step forth. <br>
When there is no peace in the family, <br>
filial piety begins. <br>
When the country falls into chaos, <br>
patriotism is born. <br>
</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter" id="19">
<h2><a href="#19">19</a></h2>
<p>
Throw away holiness and wisdom, <br>
and people will be a hundred times happier. <br>
Throw away morality and justice, <br>
and people will do the right thing. <br>
Throw away industry and profit, <br>
and there won’t be any thieves. <br>
</p><p>
If these three aren’t enough, <br>
just stay at the center of the circle <br>
and let all things take their course. <br>

<p>
Stop thinking, and end your problems. <br>
What difference between yes and no? <br>
What difference between success and failure? <br>
Must you value what others value, <br>
avoid what others avoid? <br>
How ridiculous! <br>
</p><p>
Other people are excited, <br>
as though they were at a parade. <br>
I alone don’t care, <br>
I alone am expressionless, <br>
like an infant before it can smile. <br>
</p><p>
Other people have what they need; <br>
I alone possess nothing. <br>
I alone drift about, <br>
like someone without a home. <br>
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty. <br>
</p><p>
Other people are bright; <br>
I alone am dark. <br>
Other people are sharper; <br>
I alone am dull. <br>
Other people have a purpose; <br>
I alone don’t know. <br>
I drift like a wave on the ocean, <br>
I blow as aimless as the wind. <br>
</p><p>
I am different from ordinary people. <br>
I drink from the Great Mother’s breasts. <br>

<h2><a href="#21">21</a></h2>
<p>
The Master keeps her mind <br>
always at one with the Tao; <br>
that is what gives her her radiance. <br>
</p><p>
The Tao is ungraspable. <br>
How can her mind be at one with it? <br>
Because she doesn’t cling to ideas. <br>
</p><p>
The Tao is dark and unfathomable. <br>
How can it make her radiant? <br>
Because she lets it. <br>
</p><p>
Since before time and space were, <br>
the Tao is. <br>
It is beyond is and is not. <br>
How do I know this is true? <br>
I look inside myself and see. <br>

If you want to become whole, <br>
let yourself be partial. <br>
If you want to become straight, <br>
let yourself be crooked. <br>
If you want to become full, <br>
let yourself be empty. <br>
If you want to be reborn, <br>
let yourself die. <br>
If you want to be given everything, <br>
give everything up. <br>
</p><p>
The Master, by residing in the Tao, <br>
sets an example for all beings. <br>
Because he doesn’t display himself, <br>
people can see his light. <br>
Because he has nothing to prove, <br>
people can trust his words. <br>
Because he doesn’t know who he is, <br>
people recognize themselves in him. <br>
Because he has no goad in mind, <br>
everything he does succeeds. <br>
</p><p>
When the ancient Masters said, <br>
“If you want to be given everything, <br>
give everything up,” <br>
they weren’t using empty phrases. <br>
Only in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself. <br>

Express yourself completely, <br>

Be like the forces of nature: <br>
when it blows, there is only wind; <br>
when it rains, there is only rain; <br>
when the clouds pass, the sun shines through. <br>
</p><p>
If you open yourself to the Tao, <br>
you are at one with the Tao <br>
and you can embody it completely. <br>
If you open yourself to insight, <br>
you are at one with insight <br>
and you can use it completely. <br>
If you open yourself to loss, <br>
you are at one with loss <br>
and you can accept it completely. <br>

Open yourself to the Tao, <br>
then trust your natural responses; <br>

He who stands on tiptoe <br>

He who rushes ahead <br>

He who tries to shine <br>
dims his own light. <br>
He who defines himself <br>

He who has power over others <br>
can’t empower himself. <br>
He who clings to his work <br>

There was something formless and perfect <br>
before the universe was born. <br>
It is serene. Empty. <br>
Solitary. Unchanging. <br>
Infinite. Eternally present. <br>
It is the mother of the universe. <br>
For lack of a better name, <br>
I call it the Tao. <br>
</p><p>
It flows through all things, <br>
inside and outside, and returns <br>
to the origin of all things. <br>
</p><p>
The Tao is great. <br>
The universe is great. <br>
Earth is great. <br>
Man is great. <br>
These are the four great powers. <br>
</p><p>
Man follows the earth. <br>
Earth follows the universe. <br>
The universe follows the Tao. <br>
The Tao follows only itself. <br>

The heavy is the root of the light. <br>
The unmoved is the source of all movement. <br>
</p><p>
Thus the Master travels all day <br>
without leaving home. <br>
However splendid the views, <br>
she stays serenely in herself. <br>
</p><p>
Why should the lord of the country <br>
flit about like a fool? <br>
If you let yourself be blown to and fro, <br>
you lose touch with your root. <br>
If you let restlessness move you, <br>
you lose touch with who you are. <br>

A good traveler has no fixed plans <br>
and is not intent upon arriving. <br>
A good artist lets his intuition <br>
lead him wherever it wants. <br>
A good scientist has freed himself of concepts <br>
and keeps his mind open to what is. <br>
</p><p>
Thus the Master is available to all people <br>
and doesn’t reject anyone. <br>
He is ready to use all situations <br>
and doesn’t waste anything. <br>
This is called embodying the light. <br>

What is a good man but a bad man’s teacher? <br>
What is a bad man but a good man’s job? <br>

It is the great secret. <br>

If you receive the world, <br>

Know the white, <br>
yet keep to the black: <br>
be a pattern for the world. <br>
If you are a pattern for the world, <br>
the Tao will be strong inside you <br>

Know the personal, <br>

It can’t be improved. <br>
If you tamper with it, you’ll ruin it. <br>
If you treat it like an object, you’ll lose it. <br>

Whoever relies on the Tao in governing men <br>

For every force there is a counterforce. <br>
Violence, even well intentioned, <br>
always rebounds upon oneself. <br>

The Master does his job <br>

He understands that the universe <br>

Because he believes in himself, <br>
he doesn’t try to convince others. <br>

Weapons are the tools of fear; <br>

Peace is his highest value. <br>
If the peace has been shattered, <br>
how can he be content? <br>
His enemies are not demons, <br>

He doesn’t wish them personal harm. <br>
Nor does he rejoice in victory. <br>
How could he rejoice in victory <br>

It pours itself into its work, <br>
yet it makes no claim. <br>
It nourishes infinite worlds, <br>
yet it doesn’t hold on to them. <br>
Since it is merged with all things <br>
and hidden in their hearts, <br>
it can be called humble. <br>
Since all things vanish into it <br>

The Tao never does anything, <br>

If powerful men and women <br>
could venter themselves in it, <br>
the whole world would be transformed <br>
by itself, in its natural rhythms. <br>
People would be content <br>
with their simple, everyday lives, <br>

The Master doesn’t try to be powerful; <br>
thus he is truly powerful. <br>
The ordinary man keeps reaching for power; <br>
thus he never has enough. <br>
</p><p>
The Master does nothing, <br>
yet he leaves nothing undone. <br>
The ordinary man is always doing things, <br>
yet many more are left to be done. <br>
</p><p>
The kind man does something, <br>
yet something remains undone. <br>
The just man does something, <br>
and leaves many things to be done. <br>
The moral man does something, <br>

he rolls up his sleeves and uses force. <br>

When the Tao is lost, there is goodness. <br>
When goodness is lost, there is morality. <br>
When morality is lost, there is ritual. <br>
Ritual is the husk of true faith, <br>
the beginning of chaos. <br>
</p><p>
Therefore the Master concerns himself <br>
with the depths and not the surface, <br>
with the fruit and not the flower. <br>
He has no will of his own. <br>
He dwells in reality, <br>
and lets all illusions go. <br>

When man interferes with the Tao, <br>
the sky becomes filthy, <br>
the earth becomes depleted, <br>

The Master views the parts with compassion, <br>

people turn to religion. <br>
When they no longer trust themselves, <br>
they begin to depend upon authority. <br>
</p><p>
Therefore the Master steps back <br>
so that people won’t be confused. <br>
He teaches without a teaching, <br>
so that people will have nothing to learn. <br>

The Tao is always at ease. <br>
It overcomes without competing, <br>
answers without speaking a word, <br>
arrives without being summoned, <br>
accomplishes without a plan. <br>
</p><p>
Its net covers the whole universe. <br>
And though its meshes are wide, <br>
it doesn’t let a thing slip through. <br>

If you realize that all things change, <br>
there is nothing you will try to hold on to. <br>
If you aren’t afraid of dying, <br>
there is nothing you can’t achieve. <br>
</p><p>
Trying to control the future <br>
is like trying to take the master carpenter’s place. <br>
When you handle the master carpenter’s tools, <br>
chances are that you’ll cut your hand. <br>

When taxes are too high, <br>
people go hungry. <br>
When the government is too intrusive, <br>
people lose their spirit. <br>

Act for the people’s benefit. <br>
Trust them; leave them alone. <br>

Men are born soft and supple; <br>
dead, they are stiff and hard. <br>
Plats are born tender and pliant; <br>
dead, they are brittle and dry. <br>
</p><p>
Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible <br>
is a disciple of death. <br>
Whoever is soft and yielding <br>
is a disciple of life. <br>
</p><p>
The hard and stiff will be broken. <br>
The soft and supple will prevail. <br>

As it acts in the world, the Tao <br>
is like the bending of a bow. <br>
The top is bent downward; <br>
the bottom is bent up. <br>
It adjusts excess and deficiency <br>
so that there is perfect balance. <br>
It takes from what is too much <br>
and give to what isn’t enough. <br>
</p><p>
Those who try to control, <br>
who use force to protect their power, <br>
go against the direction of the Tao. <br>
They take from those who don’t have enough <br>
and give to those who have far too much. <br>
</p><p>
The Master can keep giving <br>
because there is no end to her wealth. <br>
She acts without expectation, <br>
succeeds without taking credit, <br>
and doesn’t think that she is better <br>
than anyone else. <br>

Nothing in the world <br>
is as soft and yielding as water. <br>
Yet for dissolving the hard and inflexible, <br>
nothing can surpass it. <br>
</p><p>
The soft overcomes the hard; <br>
the gentle overcomes the rigid. <br>
Everyone knows this is true, <br>
but few can put it into practice. <br>
</p><p>
Therefore the Master remains <br>
serene in the midst of sorrow. <br>
Evil cannot enter his heart. <br>
Because he has given up helping, <br>
he is people’s greatest help. <br>
</p><p>
True words seem paradoxical. <br>

Failure is an opportunity. <br>
If you blame someone else, <br>
there is no end to the blame. <br>
</p><p>
Therefore the Master <br>
fulfills her own obligations <br>
and corrects her own mistakes. <br>
She does what she needs to do <br>
and demands nothing of others. <br>

If a country is governed wisely, <br>
its inhabitants will be content. <br>
They enjoy the labor of their hands <br>
and don’t waste time inventing <br>
labor-saving machines. <br>
Since they dearly love their homes, <br>
they aren’t interested in travel. <br>
There may be a few wagons and boats, <br>
but these don’t go anywhere. <br>
There may be an arsenal of weapons, <br>
but nobody ever uses them. <br>
People enjoy their food, <br>
take pleasure in being with their families, <br>
spend weekends working in their gardens, <br>
delight in the doings of the neighborhood. <br>
And even though the next country is so close <br>
that people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking, <br>
they are content to die of old age <br>
without ever having gone to see it. <br>

True words aren’t eloquent; <br>
eloquent words aren’t true. <br>
Wise men don’t need to prove their point; <br>
men who need to prove their point aren’t wise. <br>

The Master has no possessions. <br>
The more he does for others, <br>
the happier he is. <br>
The more he gives to others, <br>
the wealthier he is. <br>

The Tao nourishes by not forcing. <br>
By not dominating, the Master leads. <br>
