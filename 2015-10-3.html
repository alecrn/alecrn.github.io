    <h2>Better Software</h2>
    <p>Software could be better. This document outlines principles that should be
adhered, and ways that existing systems could improve.</p>

<h2>Before-optimization principle</h2>

<p>Before optimizing something, recognize the essential model. That which is most
self consistent, least error prone, most intuitive.</p>

<p>Start from this; you know that any optimizations you make will match this model.
This is how you avoid accidentally optimizing something in a way that introduces
inconsistency.</p>

<h2>Minimal data principle</h2>

<p>Keep the smallest data possible, from which all that remains can be derived.</p>

<p>This is how systems should be designed. Sure, caching is used for optimization.
But given the before-optimization principle, it should <em>act</em> like all the data
is derived from a kernel.</p>

<p>Truly compressed data is actually just an integer from a set of integers. It&rsquo;s
impossible to create compressed data that&rsquo;s &quot;wrong.&quot; If it&rsquo;s possible for data
in a model to be inconsistent, then that&rsquo;s a facet which could be compressed
further.</p>

<p>Typically there is a difference between core and representation.</p>

<pre><code>Render :: Core -&gt; Representation
</code></pre>

<p>Because the core is always self-consistent with respect to the model, all
updates are done on the core, rather than the representation. Then the
representation is recomputed from the core.</p>

<p>I should find that article on optimizing a function that follows this pattern.</p>

<h2>Languages</h2>

<p>Dependent typing needs to be more popular.</p>

<p>One of the cores of programming is the function. Functions represent
dependency; you give me this, I&rsquo;ll give you back this. Addition asks for two
numbers and returns a number, for instance.</p>

<p>Dependent typing makes it possible for functions to depend on proofs instead of
just what we&rsquo;d normally call values. For instance, a function to retrieve an
item from an array might look like</p>

<pre><code>getIndex(array of A, integer index, proof that index &lt; len(array)) -&gt; A
</code></pre>

<p>There could be a language for which the compilation target is a library. That
is, instead of compiling program A to binary B, you run program A, which
produces binary B.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;d be libraries for emitting machine code. This also means you could
create your own DSL for CSS, HTMl, JavaScript, etc.</p>

<p>Using the same dependent programming ideas, this could be incredibly safe and
fast. You could program at the assembly level in a completely safe way.</p>

<p>Also, like lisp, code should just be data. This fits in with the idea the idea
that the program just generates code. For instance if we have a function</p>

<pre><code>(def (hypotenuse a b) (sqrt (+ (** a 2) (** b 2))))
</code></pre>

<p>Or somesuch, the code is just code, ready to be interpreted by anything else. A
javascript compiler could handle it one way, a native compiler a different way.
The compiler itself is programmed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be even safer than Rust.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time for silly errors to be gone from software.</p>

<p>This&rsquo;d also make it VASTLY easier to make JITs. For instance, since the
compiler code is just part of the language, it&rsquo;d be easy to compile regular
expressions at runtime. Or SQL queries.</p>

<h2>Terminal</h2>

<p>Terminals are old and suck.</p>

<p>Replace it all with a graphical windowing system.</p>

<p>The advantage of a terminal is it&rsquo;s an extremely portable medium for programs.
You can easily SSH with a terminal. It&rsquo;s dead easy to write utilities for a
terminal.</p>

<p>A program gets a box it can draw into. It&rsquo;s just a grid of pixels. Userspace
libraries handle text, etc. Programs would be consistent across platforms and
very fast.</p>

<p>Built in would be a fast implementation of a React-like diff engine. The
program would generate each frame from scratch and hand it to the windower. If
the window is being viewed over a connection like SSH, it&rsquo;d be serialized in a
very efficient manner. Otherwise it could be directly updated in a quick way.</p>

<p>Programs would also have access to the raw stream so they can be more efficient
if necessary, like a video player.</p>

<p>The shell and tiling window system would pretty much be the same. The shell
just allocates space/tiles to different subprograms.</p>

<p>This&rsquo;d finally make it possible to view an image directly in the shell. Or have
much better displays for data.</p>

<h2>Editors</h2>

<p>There should be a tree based editor that edits the structure of things, not the
character grid.</p>

<p>For instance given</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;/mylink&quot;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You&rsquo;d navigate it more like the following tree</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;/mylink&quot;&gt;name&lt;/a&gt;
     &lt;a href=&quot;/mylink&quot;&gt;
        a
        href=&quot;/mylink&quot;
            href
            &quot;/mylink&quot;
        name
</code></pre>

<p>If you typed a double quote into the quoted string, it&rsquo;d automatically be
escaped to <code>&amp;quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Operations that could be performed in the editor would include swapping
siblings, deleting nodes, adding nodes, editing nodes, etc.</p>

<p>Code would always have correct syntax and be correctly formatted, because it&rsquo;s
impossible to have it any other way.</p>

<p>Same as the minimal data principle.</p>

<p>Like react, you edit the core data, and the representation (text) is computed
from that. Thus the code is always correct, and edits are optimal.</p>

<p>The editor could simultaneously edit the filesystem too, since that&rsquo;s a tree as
well. However, that might be a bit harder to think about, as the file system
changes underneath the editor.</p>

<p>Either way similar tree-navigation keystrokes could be used.</p>

<h2>Distribution/anarchy</h2>

<p>So much software depends on a client/server architecture.</p>

<p>This is generally for two reasons: to distribute the use of resources, and to
share data.</p>

<p>For instance, you don&rsquo;t need all of Netflix&rsquo;s movies on your computer, so you
use their storage space. Plus when new movies and shows come out, you want to
watch them.</p>

<p>But there are some issues for this. For one, the system completely depends on
the server to be up. It&rsquo;s an obvious bottleneck point. Plus, it doesn&rsquo;t make
sense that only one person can host the same thing; someone else should be able
to spin up their own server which does the same thing.</p>

<p>More software should be distributed. Like git. Almost exactly like git, in
many ways.</p>

<p>Operations occur on local data, which is then pushed/pulled as needed.</p>

<p>For instance, my calorie counter could push/pull data from a central server.
This is optional, but may be convenient. It can be any server I wish. And it&rsquo;s
just simple data.</p>

<p>Then my desktop can pull from the same data.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d operate on the data locally. Hopefully with a nice GUI application. But it
<em>could</em> be anything. Since it&rsquo;s just data. If it&rsquo;s just an sqlite3 file, I
could poke around it with my sqlite3 client if I wanted.</p>

<p>I imagine a system like git that&rsquo;s more general. It handles more kinds of data,
and isn&rsquo;t in any way geared toward code. Diffs would be binary diffs; maybe
even just gzip deltas (or something similar), or custom for the application.</p>

<p>It would handle pushing, pulling, dealing with multiple remotes and branches.</p>

<p>This raises the question of merging.</p>

<p>Monotonic data is always mergeable. Which is important.</p>

<p>So most applications could use some kind of monotonic data, which takes care of
merging.</p>

<p>Another important kind of resource is computation. It should be easy to
distribute computational resources, the same way you might with storage.</p>

<p>Take the source code for a server, and put it up on rented hardware.</p>

<p>Rented resources should be paid for. Otherwise, who is, and why?</p>

<p>With the window manager, I could run programs on a different computer and stream
them to mine pretty easily.</p>

<p>Lots of existing websites would be fascinating if they were distributed.</p>

<p>BitTorrent already covers a lot of media sharing, like games, movies, music,
books, software, etc. etc.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;d be great to see bittorrent for package managers.</p>

<p>The almost more interesting ones are more computational platforms.</p>

<p>For instance, tumblr, twitter. These lend themselves to distribution.</p>

<p>Ebay and craigslist and other markets could be local.</p>

<p>The memex would be a great example that covers a lot of these.</p>

<p>Encryption and authentication are significant here. It also implies a web of
trust.</p>

<h2>Data market</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;d be cool to have a free market of data. Like bittorrent, but you auction
off your data.</p>

<p>This would offset the costs of seeding, encourage people to seed, and encourage
people to find valuable data to seed.</p>

<p>Some people could even have a side business of scanning, e.g. textbooks and
seeding them.</p>

<p>As data distributes throughout the system, costs plummet, but probably staying
above a certain minimum amount to offset bandwidth/cpu cycle costs.</p>

<p>The hardest part might be verifying the correctness of data. Since people would
probably try to cheat. Money would have to be stored in escrow or somesuch.</p>

<h2>Privacy/encryption</h2>

<p>As many things should be encrypted/authenticated as possible. This is important
in a distributed world, as well as a time of NSA spying.</p>

<p>Distributed, encrypted markets/networks could circumvent so much silliness.</p>
